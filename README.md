Created a small service in Golang to check if the URLs given are healthy.

It will take URLs to be checked, CrawlTime( time for which system will wait before giving up on URL), frequency(time for which system will wait before retrying) and failure threshold(Number of times systems will try before finally giving up) and check if the URLs are up or not.
